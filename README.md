### PythonOS
This Operating System is made by a popular programming language called Python.
But this OS still uses a non-GUI mode to run.
 
### Installation manual:
    1.Double-click the 'main.exe' file to run the terminal
    2.Wait for it to load
    3.Type your name or desired username
    4.Enjoy!
    P.S. You need a Windows comouter to run this application. Linux edition coming up!
Please report if there are any bugs in this OS. Or, if you have any suggestions, just let me know.
This software isn't developed by Python or Python Software Foundation.
You can download this software from https://github.com/milo1004/PythonOS.git

### News:
  I and my 'team' are going to release a bootable edition to install.
  Install it on a Virtual Machine is recomended. The Operating System will use a Linux Kernel, but   still, a terminal-based OS.
